# Reinforcement learning project

This repository contains an implementation of Deep Q Network that plays the Atari game "Breakout".  
It is much inspired by this implementation 

https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl

The project has been written in Keras and Python and uses OpenAI Gym and ALE.
